# The Coffee Day Kowdiar

The OG Cafe Experience in Trivandrum. Most folks here come for work especially the more adult crowd, there is always a business talk going over there. Has a more of a cozy closed space vibe, so if you like working in your little corner this the spot. There are power outlets but not enough for everyone inside, the outdoors has a few more. You can spot regulars here.

Hot choco here is bad though, I instead opt for a chicken burger. I come here to just work and for a few meetups.
