# Eve's Coffee

Not the place I go to work tho, its more of a great fun hangout place. Got plenty of board games and books/comics to read. You can stay as long as you want within open hours after ordering something. Its a happening place, folks host meetups and you can see some community activity going on now and then.

The hot choco here slaps, really gets to my head and I love it. The staff there is really accomodating and friendly so you can talk about anything you need without shying away.
