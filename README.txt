# Hey
Welcome to My Cafe List. This is my little curation of cafes I go to work at and a few places I like to hangout at. You can find the list at : https://cafe.aicproject.cc/

This repo contains the data thats used to generate the website. The websites source code is closed but the data is public

Its a fun little quirky project I built cause I was procrastinating on work.

## How to contribute

Each folder in there correspond to a location, we right now have bangalore, kochi and trivandrum.
Within each folder is a ranking.csv and then the md files

When you want to add a cafe add your cafes name to the list in the order that you think fits (I will probably reorder this after we discuss over on the PR lol)

Then add a new md file in the location folder with the name as the slug and add the details.

It might take a bit for me to merge the PR, I would also love to talk about the PR itself and why you think the cafe is nice and ranked it that way (cause again its my list in a sense) so looking forward to a great chit chat as well.
